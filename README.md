# Kitchen Timer
[![Android Weekly](https://androidweekly.net/issues/issue-462/badge)](https://androidweekly.net/issues/issue-462) [![Featured in Compose Academy - Issue #13](https://img.shields.io/badge/Featured_in_Compose_Academy-Issue_%2313-2ea44f)](https://academy.us7.list-manage.com/track/click?u=68cc676cd60c12ff962c2f023&id=b56c081d50&e=9f80514374)



## Motivation and Context
To commemorate Jetpack Compose first beta release, Google launched the [#AndroidDevChallenge](https://developer.android.com/dev-challenge). In the 2nd round, contestants were asked to create a simple countdown app and, the idea to create a kitchen timer, popped in my head.
By then, I didn't had the time to accomplish it in one week, so I submitted a [simpler one](https://github.com/GuilhE/OneHotMinute-Compose), but now that I have it, this is the result ðŸ˜Š

I've wrote a Medium post explaining the process and you can read it here [Compose, Camera and Canvas.](https://guidelgado.medium.com/compose-camera-and-canvas-87b8cfed8cda)
